DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. In traditional setups, developers and operations teams often work in silos, which can lead to miscommunication, bottlenecks, and slower release cycles.
In DevOps, both teams work closely together, from planning and coding to building, testing, and deployment, fostering a more
 collaborative and transparent working environment.
Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, Ansible, Chef, and Puppet help automate the software delivery pipeline.
DevOps can lead to cost savings through automation and improved resource usage. By minimizing manual intervention and reducing errors, businesses can save on operational costs.
