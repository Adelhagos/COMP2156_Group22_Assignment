DevOps helps teams deliver software faster by automating repetitive tasks (e.g., builds, deployments) and integrating continuous delivery practices (CI/CD).
CI/CD pipelines automate the process of integrating and deploying code changes. This reduces errors, enhances code quality, and enables more frequent releases.
DevOps ensures that every change is integrated and tested automatically, making it easier to detect and fix issues earlier in the development process
DevOps helps teams to build scalable systems that can adapt to the growing needs of an organization.
